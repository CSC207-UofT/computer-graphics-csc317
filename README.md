## Course Overview

This course introduces the basic concepts and algorithms of computer graphics.
It covers the basic methods needed to model and render 3D objects, including
much of the following: graphics displays, basic optics, affine and
perspective transformations, windows and viewports, visibility,											
illumination and reflectance models, parametric representations, curves and surfaces, texture mapping, graphics
hardware, ray tracing, graphics toolkits, animation systems.


**Prerequisites:** C/C++ Programming, Linear Algebra, Calculus,([course
codes](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc317h1).


## Discussion Board

Please post your questions about the lectures, readings, and assignment due dates on the
[Quercus discussion
board](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/280982/discussion_topics). We will monitor
this board and attempt to answer questions as they appear. Near deadlines
responses may take longer, so please start assignments early. If your question
is not being answered, you may ask it again at the tutorial or office hours.

For questions specific to each assignment, please post your questions as a GitHub issue
on the assignment repository.

## Assignment Policies

Assignments must be submitted electronically, using [MarkUs](https://markus.teach.cs.toronto.edu/2022-01).

Code that you submit to us must work on the CS Teaching Lab machines in order to earn credit.
																	   
																				
																			  
																				
																				
				   

0.007% off for every minute late.

All assignments must be completed individually.
		   
																				
																		
																			 
						
																			
																			  
																				
														  

### Academic Honesty

Any code must belong to the student submitting it. Submitted assignments will
be automatically analyzed to identify suspicious levels of code similarity.
Consequences of committing an academic offence can be severe.
